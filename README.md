# Automated-Data-Collection-and-CSV-Storage-from-Global-Warming-API-using-Python
In this project we aim to collect data on climate for example temperature changes, carbon emission levels etc to the be able to provide an analysis of temperature anomalies over time, focusing on data cleaning, outlier handling, and visualizations to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. The final analysis would lead to a clearer understanding of temperature trends and variations between measurements taken at different locations (stations) and over land.
